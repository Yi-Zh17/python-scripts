# python-scripts

## This repository contains some of my previous python scripts.

### wikidata:
This script opens a browser and searches for items listed in a sample file on Wikidata. It was first created for collecting all the statements that are missing for a set of game that I would like to edit on Wikidata. However, the code can also be adapted for general auto searching on the internet. The script operates with Selenium, so it does not cause too much burden to the server.
